  - Implementing STP port roles and states



---

### 4. DNS (Domain Name System)
- **Description**: Resolves human-readable hostnames to IP addresses, simplifying access to network resources and enhancing usability.
- **Configuration Skills**:
  - Setting up DNS zones and records
  - Configuring forward and reverse lookup
  - Troubleshooting DNS resolution issues



---

### 5. Layer 2 Switching
- **Description**: Utilizes switches to facilitate efficient data transfer within the same network segment, optimizing local area network (LAN) performance.
- **Configuration Skills**:
  - Understanding switch port configurations
  - Implementing VLANs for traffic segmentation
  - Configuring trunk and access ports


---

### 6. Layer 3 Routing
- **Description**: Enables communication between different VLANs and subnets through routing protocols, allowing for a structured and organized network.
- **Configuration Skills**:
  - Configuring static and dynamic routing
  - Understanding routing tables
  - Implementing inter-VLAN routing



---

### 7. VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
- **Description**: Segregates network traffic, improving security and performance by isolating different types of traffic within the network.
- **Configuration Skills**:
  - Creating and managing VLANs
  - Configuring VLAN tagging
  - Implementing VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
